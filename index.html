<p class ="p1"> My name is Alex Johan Urena Figueroa, I am originally from the Dominican Republic, I am 18 years old.</p>

<p class="p1">I came to the United States in 2019 at the age of 15. I was in several schools before entering Madison Park High school (<strong>vocational school</strong>)</p>

<p class="p1">Since I was 14 years old I wanted to study programming since I was influenced by the fact that video games are made by programming languages.</p>
